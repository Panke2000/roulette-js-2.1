THIS IS A SIMPLE ROULETTE BROWSER GAME!


HOW TO START?
Run "index.html" and enjoy!

SOURCES?
- Chips were made by me so feel free to use them if you want!
- Audio files were downloaded from some royalty free sites i found on Google.
- Patterns were generated on this site: https://bg.siteorigin.com/
  C'mon! Why do you care anyways? It's an educational project, not a money making app.

Have any questions or recommendations? Or just want to correct or suggest something?
Feel free to post an Issue. :)
